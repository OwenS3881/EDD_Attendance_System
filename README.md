# UTrack

UTrack was a prototype system I developed as part of my senior year Engineering Design and Development PLTW capstone project. UTrack is a new way to track the attendance of a school that allows for students to mark themselves present by using QR codes that are unique to the teacher and day. The mobile App Beta is currently available for iOS devices only at the moment and the web portal can be accessed through this web page.
